        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>What is an example of a summary of text?
        The act of summarizing is much like stating the plot of a play. For instance, if you were asked to summarize the story of Shakespeare's 'Hamlet,' you might say: <span>It's the story of a young prince of Denmark who discovers that his uncle and his mother have killed his father, the former king </span></p>
